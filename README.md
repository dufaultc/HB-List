# HB-List
An assignment based on the implementation of a "horizontal-bottom" linked list structure in C with the goal of flattening the structure into a singly linked list with keys in increasing order. The list.c file is the one I created, the others were provided. Six function were required to be created in the list.c file.

printSLlist: Prints the keys of an SL list

printHBlist: Prints the keys of an HB list

createHBlist: Creates an HB list with random keys in increasing. The list has a number of horizontal nodes equal to n, and with each node
having a singly linked list attached to it with a number of nodes between 0 and m.

flattenList: Creates an SL list with the keys in increasing order when given an HB list to transform.

freeSLlist: Frees the memory assigned to all nodes in an SL list

freeHBlist: Frees the memory assigned to all nodes in an HB list
